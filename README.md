# Review and Comparison of Subset Selection Methods for Linear Regression

This repository contains the relevant code for the implementation of several exact and approximate methods
for the best subset selection problem in linear regression, namely:

* Lasso
* Relaxed Lasso
* A discrete first-order method
* Best subset selection as a mixed-integer program

as well as the necessary experimental setup to run simulations of each method on data sets with varying characteristics.
